# packsbyname-python
My try to resolve ArchLinux and other archbased distributions problem to easly search for packages only by it's name. Just get 'pbname.py' and check if you have Python installed. Then launch script with 'python3' prefix or change script to executable and launch it directly. Type 'pbname.py -h' for more info.

Tip: To use it more easy copy script to for example /usr/bin/ directory with sudo, make it executable and then you will can use it from any directory you want like other commands. You can change it's name to for example 'pbname' for better experience too.
