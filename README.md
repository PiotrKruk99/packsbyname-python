# packsbyname-python
My try to resolve ArchLinux and other archbased distributions problem to easly search for packages only by it's name. Just get 'pbname.py' and check if you have Python installed. Then launch script with 'python3' prefix or change script to executable and launch it directly. Type 'pbname.py -h' for more info.
